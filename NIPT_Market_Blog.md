# Global Non-invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) Market Poised to Surpass US$ 13.2 Billion by 2035: What’s Driving the Growth?

As the demand for safer, more accurate prenatal screening continues to rise, the global **non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) market** is witnessing unprecedented growth. According to recent research by *Transparency Market Research*, the NIPT market was valued at **US$ 4.7 billion in 2024** and is projected to reach **US$ 13.2 billion by 2035**, growing at a **CAGR of 9.5%** during the forecast period from 2025 to 2035.

NIPT is emerging as the go-to method for early detection of fetal chromosomal abnormalities due to its high accuracy, safety, and non-invasive nature. With technological advancements, increasing maternal age, and greater awareness of genetic conditions, the global market is expected to witness robust expansion across all major regions.

## Why Non-invasive Prenatal Testing is Gaining Ground

Non-invasive prenatal testing is performed by analyzing small fragments of fetal DNA present in a pregnant woman’s blood. Unlike traditional invasive tests like **amniocentesis** or **chorionic villus sampling (CVS)**, NIPT poses no risk to the fetus, as it requires only a blood sample from the mother. It can be conducted as early as 10 weeks into pregnancy and is used primarily to screen for **Down syndrome (trisomy 21)**, **Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)**, **Patau syndrome (trisomy 13)**, and other chromosomal anomalies.

Expectant parents and healthcare providers are increasingly favoring NIPT due to its superior accuracy over conventional non-invasive screening methods and its safety compared to invasive diagnostics. Leading products in the space include **MaterniT21 PLUS**, **Harmony**, **Panorama**, **NIFTY**, and others.

## Key Growth Drivers: Maternal Age & Down Syndrome Awareness

One of the strongest drivers of market growth is the **rising maternal age**. Globally, women are choosing to have children later in life due to factors such as financial planning, career considerations, and lifestyle choices. As maternal age increases, so does the risk of fetal chromosomal disorders. According to the **American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)**, the risk of Down syndrome increases dramatically with age—from 1 in 1,300 at age 25 to 1 in 30 at age 40.

In parallel, the **prevalence of Down syndrome** continues to be a significant global health concern. Data from **Down’s Syndrome Education (DSE) International** suggests that nearly **220,000 babies** are born with the condition each year, and the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** reports an incidence rate of 1 in every 700 births in the U.S. This awareness is leading to increased adoption of reliable screening tools like NIPT.

## Diagnostics Labs Lead the Charge

When analyzing the market by **end-users**, diagnostic laboratories are emerging as the fastest-growing segment. These labs offer specialized infrastructure, quick turnaround times, and access to advanced testing platforms. Companies like **MedGenome Labs Ltd.** are already offering a range of NIPT services, such as **Claria NIPT Plus**, which screens for conditions including **Turner Syndrome**, **Klinefelter Syndrome**, **Triple X**, **Jacob’s Syndrome**, and even rare disorders like **Prader-Willi** and **Cri-du-chat Syndrome**.

Hospitals and specialty clinics also play a significant role, but diagnostic labs stand out for their ability to rapidly adopt and scale new testing technologies.

## Technological Advancements Fuel Market Momentum

The NIPT landscape is being shaped by continuous innovation in **genomics and sequencing technologies**. Tools such as **whole-genome sequencing**, **single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis**, **microarray analysis**, and **rolling circle amplification** are improving test sensitivity and broadening the scope of detectable conditions.

Key players are leading with innovation. In **May 2024**, **Natera, Inc.** introduced a **cfDNA-based fetal RhD test**, a major advancement for RhD-negative pregnancies. The test showed **100% sensitivity** and **over 99% specificity** in clinical validation, highlighting the potential of NIPT beyond chromosomal screening. Similarly, **Yourgene Health**, part of the Novacyt Group, launched **IONA Care+** in the UK in early **2025**, offering faster and more accessible testing using their IONA Nx NIPT Workflow.

## Regional Insights: North America Leads, Asia Pacific Accelerates

**North America** remains the dominant player in the global NIPT market, holding an estimated **60% market share in 2024**. This is attributed to high diagnostic awareness, strong healthcare infrastructure, and the presence of major market players such as **Illumina**, **Natera**, and **LabCorp**.

Meanwhile, the **Asia Pacific** region is forecast to grow at the **fastest CAGR**. Countries like **China**, **India**, and **Japan** are seeing increasing maternal ages, rising chromosomal disorder prevalence, and rapid improvements in healthcare technology. These trends are unlocking significant potential for NIPT adoption in the region, especially as local companies expand their capabilities.

## Competitive Landscape: Strategic Moves by Key Players

The NIPT market is moderately consolidated, with several global leaders expanding their product portfolios and distribution networks. Companies are actively pursuing **strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and product launches** to maintain competitive advantage.

Noteworthy players include:

- **Natera, Inc.**
- **BGI**
- **Berry Genetics**
- **Illumina, Inc.**
- **Agilent Technologies**
- **Eurofins Scientific**
- **F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.**
- **PerkinElmer Inc.**
- **Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings**

Each of these firms is focusing on expanding test menus, improving diagnostic accuracy, and entering emerging markets to capitalize on unmet needs.

## Final Thoughts: A Market on the Rise

With growing awareness of genetic conditions, advances in biotechnology, and a shift toward non-invasive diagnostic methods, the non-invasive prenatal testing market is poised for long-term growth. As healthcare providers and patients alike prioritize safety, accuracy, and early detection, NIPT is expected to become a standard part of prenatal care globally.

As the industry evolves, ongoing research, regulatory support, and technological innovation will continue to shape the future of prenatal diagnostics—offering hope and clarity to millions of expectant families around the world.
